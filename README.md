Understanding the fourier transforms

Exploring the importance of Phase

This is program that reads two different images g(x; y) and h(x; y) of exactly
the same spatial extension (e.g. bauckhage.jpg and clock.jpg). Then, let you program compute
the Fourier transforms Gand H respectively. Next, compute the
magnitude of all the entries of G and the phase of all entries of H. Now
compute K where the magnitude of K comes from G and the phase
information comes form H. Compute the inverse Fourier transform of K.

We observe that the output image K gets the edge details from phase.
